					<h1>About Me.</h1>
					<p>I was born on October 11th, 1994. I have lived my whole life in a small city in Latvia called Grobina, it is 10km away from Liepaja, the third largest city in Latvia. My hometown has around 4000 people living in it.</p>

					<br><p>My childhood was mostly spent playing outside. I went to a kindergarden in my city, but always despised going there, I eventually graduated and went to my city school where I finished twelve grades.</p>
					<br><p align="right">This is me! In kindergarden!</p>
					<br><p>After graduating high school, I had to choose to which university to go to. I heard about LCC from my english teacher. I liked the idea of an english languange school that had a major in business. Also, there was the benefit of living just an hour away from Klaipeda. So my last three and a half years have been spent here and it has been a great experience.</p>
					<p>I still haven't figured out what I am going to do after finishing by Bachelors at LCC. Perhaps I'll continue to study towards a Masters degree, but who knows what'll happen.</p>
